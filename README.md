# CodeAlpha_Sales_Prediction
## Overview
Sales prediction is a crucial aspect for businesses to forecast the potential demand for their products or services. By analyzing various factors—such as advertising spend, target audience segments, and advertising platforms—this project predicts future sales trends. Such predictions enable product and service-based businesses to optimize their advertising strategies and budgeting.


This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze data and predict sales, helping companies make data-driven decisions and improve ROI on advertising.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various factors that impact sales:
* No of TV
* No of Radio
* No of newspaper
* Sales
These attributes provide a comprehensive view of how different factors contribute to sales outcomes.

## Model
For this project, we used the Linear Regression model (or specify your model, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.). Linear Regression is well-suited for predictive modeling, particularly when there is a relationship between input variables and the target variable, sales. The model was trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for accuracy to ensure reliable predictions.

## Workflow
* Data Collection: Gather data with features that impact sales.
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Address missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distributions and relationships to inform model design.
* Model Training: Train the chosen model on the training data.
* Model Evaluation: Test the model’s performance and adjust for better accuracy.
* Prediction: Use the trained model to forecast future sales based on advertising and demographic inputs.
